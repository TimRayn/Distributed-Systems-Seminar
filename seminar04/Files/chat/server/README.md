Installing the Chat Server into Eclipse
-------
Assuming that you have Eclipse with WASP Developer up and running, install the sample code.
(if not - here's Eclipse tutorial https://www.javahelps.com/2015/03/install-latest-eclipse-in-ubuntu.html and then just install WASP Developer right in Eclipse)

- In Eclipse create a new project (File -> New -> Project...). Choose the Systinet Web Services/Web Service Project.
- In the following dialog enter the project name, ChatServiceProject and location. Finish the wizard.
- From the File menu, choose the Import... command, and choose the Zip file method (for zip file).
- In the following dialog choose the zip file downloaded earlier as the source, and click on the Finish button.

Your project should now contain the two packages with the source for the Chat Service (if it`s not - you did something wrong). You can verify this by examining the Package Explore view.
